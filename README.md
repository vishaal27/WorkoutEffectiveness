# WorkoutEffectiveness

This is code for the course project for the Machine Learning(CSE343) Fall'18 course offered in IIIT Delhi. Our project was to build a machine learning model to classify the exercise being performed by a person and also estimate the effectiveness of the performed exercise by using probabilistic evaluation metrics.
